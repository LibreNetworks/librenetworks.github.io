    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Libre Networks is a community-driven movement defending the open internet.<br>
      Around the world, websites and governments are increasingly restricting access—requiring IDs, deploying age-check AI, and limiting freedom. This approach is flawed and puts privacy, safety, and universal access at risk.<br>
      Major organizations like Wikipedia, 4chan, and Apple have challenged these restrictions in court, fighting for a safer, freer web.<br>
      <strong>Now, we’re asking you to stand with us.</strong>

    <h2>Sign the Petition: Defend the Open Internet</h2>
    <p>
      We believe the web should be:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> No unnecessary barriers, ID checks, or invasive surveillance.</li>
        <li><strong>Private:</strong> Your browsing, identity, and conversations stay yours.</li>
        <li><strong>Open:</strong> No government or corporation should decide who gets to connect.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <strong>Sign our petition to demand:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Protection against mandatory age or ID verification for general web use.</li>
        <li>Safeguards against AI-based surveillance and censorship.</li>
        <li>Transparent, community-driven standards for online safety and privacy.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      Every signature sends a message to lawmakers, companies, and the world: <em>keep the internet free and open for all.</em>

  <section class="why">
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
      The web was built to connect people freely, not gatekeep or monitor. Forced ID checks and age AI threaten:
      <ul>
        <li>Access for marginalized users, privacy advocates, and those in restrictive countries.</li>
        <li>Whistleblowers, activists, and regular people who just want safety and privacy.</li>
        <li>The free flow of information and ideas that drives progress.</li>
      </ul>

      <summary>Why is age/ID verification a problem?</summary>
